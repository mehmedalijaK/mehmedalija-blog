My name is **Mehmedalija Karišik**, and I am a software engineer from Belgrade, Serbia.  
I graduated from the **School of Computing (Computer Science program)**, where I currently work as a **teaching assistant** in the *Compilers* course. I help students build their own interpreters while guiding them through the main phases and structures of a compiler.

Professionally, I work as a **Native Kotlin Android Developer** on the development of the decentralized Nostr application **Primal**. My work includes:  

- Optimizing feed performance through improvements to ExoPlayer and image rendering  
- Developing livestream functionality (live streaming, chat, donations, and other interactive features)  
- Integrating with crypto NWC wallets, enabling zaps and other crypto interactions  
- Building additional screens and features as required by the application  

Beyond Android development (**Kotlin, KMP, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, MVC**), I also have strong experience with **Java** and the **Spring Boot** ecosystem. I am particularly passionate about **compilers and interpreters**, systems programming, and operating systems such as **xv6**. I also enjoy exploring **parallel programming** and **CUDA** technology.  
Although my main focus lies in these fundamental areas, I also work with modern web technologies like **React** and **Next.js**.

My current professional focus is on **decentralized systems, mobile development, and compiler design**. I actively contribute to the **Nostr protocol** through my work on the Primal Android client.
